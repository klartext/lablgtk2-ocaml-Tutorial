collection of other widgets. From the user's point of view, the widget
consists of a text entry box and a pull down menu from which the user
can select one of a set of predefined entries. Alternatively, the user
can type a different option directly into the text box.</p><p>The following extract child widgets from a Combo Box:</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">method entry : entry
method list : GList.liste</pre></td></tr></table><p>As you can see, the Combo Box has two principal parts that you really
care about: an entry and a list.</p><p>First off, to create a combo box, use
<a href="http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GEdit.html#VALcombo" target="_top"><tt class="LITERAL">GEdit.combo</tt></a>:</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">val GEdit.combo :
	?popdown_strings:string list -&#62;
	?allow_empty:bool -&#62;
	?case_sensitive:bool -&#62;
	?enable_arrow_keys:bool -&#62;
	?value_in_list:bool -&#62;
	?border_width:int -&#62;
	?width:int -&#62;
	?height:int -&#62;
	?packing:(GObj.widget -&#62; unit) -&#62;
	?show:bool -&#62; unit -&#62; combo</pre></td></tr></table><p>Now, if you want to set the string in the entry section of the combo
box, this is done by manipulating the <tt class="LITERAL">entry</tt> widget directly:</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">combo#entry#set_text "My String";</pre></td></tr></table><p>To set the values in the popdown list, one uses the function:</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">method set_popdown_strings : string list -&#62; unit</pre></td></tr></table><p>At this point you have a working combo box that has been set up.
There are a few aspects of its behavior that you can change. These
are accomplished with the functions: </p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">method set_enable_arrow_keys : bool -&#62; unit
method set_case_sensitive : bool -&#62; unit</pre></td></tr></table><p>set_enable_arrow_keys method lets the user change the value in the
entry using the up/down arrow keys. This doesn't bring up the list, but
rather replaces the current text in the entry with the next list entry
(up or down, as your key choice indicates). It does this by searching
in the list for the item corresponding to the current value in the
entry and selecting the previous/next item accordingly. Usually in an
entry the arrow keys are used to change focus (you can do that anyway
using TAB). Note that when the current item is the last of the list
and you press arrow-down it changes the focus (the same applies with
the first item and arrow-up).</p><p>If the current value in the entry is not in the list, then the
function of set_enable_arrow_keys is disabled.</p><p>set_case_sensitive method toggles whether or not GTK
searches for entries in a case sensitive manner. This is used when the
Combo widget is asked to find a value from the list using the current
entry in the text box. This completion can be performed in either a
case sensitive or insensitive manner, depending upon the use of this
function. The Combo widget can also simply complete the current entry
if the user presses the key combination MOD-1 and "Tab". MOD-1 is
often mapped to the "Alt" key, by the <tt class="LITERAL">xmodmap</tt> utility. Note,
however that some window managers also use this key combination, which
will override its use within GTK.</p><p>Now that we have a combo box, tailored to look and act how we want it,
all that remains is being able to get data from the combo box. This is
relatively straightforward. The majority of the time, all you are
going to care about getting data from is the entry. The entry is
accessed simply by <tt class="LITERAL">combo#entry</tt>. The
two principal things that you are going to want to do with it are
connect to the activate signal, which indicates that the user has
pressed the Return or Enter key, and read the text. The first is
accomplished using something like:</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">combo#entry#connect#activate ~callback:my_callback;</pre></td></tr></table><p>Getting the text at any arbitrary time is accomplished by simply using
the entry function such as:</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">let text = combo#entry#text in
...</pre></td></tr></table><p>That's about all there is to it. There is a function</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">method disable_activate : unit -&#62; unit</pre></td></tr></table><p>that will disable the activate signal on the entry widget in the combo
box. Personally, I can't think of why you'd want to use it, but it
does exist.</p></div><div class="NAVFOOTER"><hr align="LEFT" width="100%"/><table summary="Footer navigation table" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td width="33%" align="left" valign="top"><a href="x1183.html" accesskey="P">&#60;&#60;&#60; Previous</a></td><td width="34%" align="center" valign="top"><a href="book1.html" accesskey="H">Home</a></td><td width="33%" align="right" valign="top"><a href="x1307.html" accesskey="N">Next &#62;&#62;&#62;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="33%" align="left" valign="top">Spin Buttons</td><td width="34%" align="center" valign="top"><a href="c953.html" accesskey="U">Up</a></td><td width="33%" align="right" valign="top">Calendar</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
