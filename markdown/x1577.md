Viewports {.SECT1}
=========

It is unlikely that you will ever need to use the Viewport widget
directly. You are much more likely to use the [Scrolled
Window](x1595.html) widget which itself uses the Viewport.

A viewport widget allows you to place a larger widget within it such
that you can view a part of it at a time. It uses
[Adjustments](c766.html) to define the area that is currently in view.

A Viewport is created with the function
[`GBin.viewport`{.LITERAL}](http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GBin.html#VALviewport)

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
val GBin.viewport :
    ?hadjustment:GData.adjustment ->
    ?vadjustment:GData.adjustment ->
    ?shadow_type:Gtk.Tags.shadow_type ->
    ?border_width:int ->
    ?width:int ->
    ?height:int ->
    ?packing:(GObj.widget -> unit) ->
    ?show:bool -> unit -> viewport
~~~~

As you can see you can specify the horizontal and vertical Adjustments
that the widget is to use when you create the widget. It will create its
own if you don't pass the arguments.

You can get and set the adjustments after the widget has been created
using the following four functions:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
method hadjustment : GData.adjustment
method vadjustment : GData.adjustment
method set_hadjustment : GData.adjustment -> unit
method set_vadjustment : GData.adjustment -> unit
~~~~

The other viewport function is used to alter its appearance:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
method set_shadow_type : Gtk.Tags.shadow_type -> unit
~~~~

Possible values for the `Gtk.Tags.shadow_type`{.LITERAL} parameter are:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
  `NONE,
  `IN,
  `OUT,
  `ETCHED_IN,
  `ETCHED_OUT
~~~~
