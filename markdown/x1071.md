Dialogs {.SECT1}
=======

The Dialog widget is very simple, and is actually just a window with a
few things pre-packed into it for you.

It simply creates a window, and then packs a vbox into the top, which
contains a separator and then an hbox called the "action\_area". After
creating a dialog, you can reference the vbox and the action\_area using
the following methods:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
method vbox : GPack.box
method action_area : GPack.button_box
~~~~

The Dialog widget can be used for pop-up messages to the user, and other
similar tasks.
[`GWindow.dialog`{.LITERAL}](http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GWindow.html#VALdialog)
is the function which creates a new Dialog.

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
val GWindow.dialog:
    ?no_separator:bool ->
    ?parent:#window_skel ->
    ?destroy_with_parent:bool ->
    ?title:string ->
    ?allow_grow:bool ->
    ?allow_shrink:bool ->
    ?icon:GdkPixbuf.pixbuf ->
    ?modal:bool ->
    ?resizable:bool ->
    ?screen:Gdk.screen ->
    ?type_hint:Gdk.Tags.window_type_hint ->
    ?position:Gtk.Tags.window_position ->
    ?wm_name:string ->
    ?wm_class:string ->
    ?border_width:int ->
    ?width:int ->
    ?height:int ->
    ?show:bool -> unit -> [> `DELETE_EVENT ] dialog

no_separator : default value is false
destroy_with_parent : default value is false
~~~~

This function will create an empty dialog, and it is now up to you to
use it. You could pack a button in the action\_area by doing something
like this:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
let w = GWindow.dialog ... () in
let button = GButton.button ... ~packing:w#action_area#add () in
~~~~

And you could add to the vbox area by packing, for instance, a label in
it, try something like this:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
let w = GWindow.dialog ... () in
let label = GMisc.label ~text:"Dialogs are groovy" ~packing:w#vbox#add () in
~~~~

As an example in using the dialog box, you could put two buttons in the
action\_area, a Cancel button and an Ok button, and a label in the vbox
area, asking the user a question or giving an error etc. Then you could
attach a different signal to each of the buttons and perform the
operation the user selects.

If the simple functionality provided by the default vertical and
horizontal boxes in the two areas doesn't give you enough control for
your application, then you can simply pack another layout widget into
the boxes provided. For example, you could pack a table into the
vertical box.

The optional arguments allows to set one or more of the following flags.

`?modal`{.LITERAL}
:   make the dialog modal.

`?destroy_with_parent`{.LITERAL}
:   ensures that the dialog window is destroyed together with the
    parent.

`?no_separator`{.LITERAL}
:   omits the separator between the vbox and the action\_area.
