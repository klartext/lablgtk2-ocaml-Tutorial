Event Handling {.SECT1}
==============

The GTK signals we have already discussed are for high-level actions,
such as a menu item being selected. However, sometimes it is useful to
learn about lower-level occurrences, such as the mouse being moved, or a
key being pressed. There are also GTK signals corresponding to these
low-level *events*. The handlers for these signals have an extra
parameter which is a structure containing information about the event.
For instance, motion event handlers are passed a GdkEvent.Motion
structure which looks (in part) like: see
[`GdkEvent.Motion`{.LITERAL}](http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GdkEvent.Motion.html)

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
type t = [ `MOTION_NOTIFY ] Gdk.event 
val cast : GdkEvent.any -> t

val time : [< GdkEvent.timed ] Gdk.event -> int32
val x : t -> float
val y : t -> float
val axes : t -> (float * float) option
val state : t -> int
val is_hint : t -> bool
val device : t -> Gdk.device
val x_root : t -> float
val y_root : t -> float
~~~~

`x`{.LITERAL} and `y`{.LITERAL} give the coordinates of the event.
`state`{.LITERAL} specifies the modifier state when the event occurred
(that is, it specifies which modifier keys and mouse buttons were
pressed). It can contain some of the following:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
`SHIFT
`LOCK
`CONTROL
`MOD1
`MOD2
`MOD3
`MOD4
`MOD5
`BUTTON1
`BUTTON2
`BUTTON3
`BUTTON4
`BUTTON5
~~~~

You can test the state whether it includes the given modifier or not,
using one of the followings:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
val Gdk.Convert.test_modifier : Gdk.Tags.modifier -> int -> bool
val Gdk.Convert.modifier : int -> Gdk.Tags.modifier list
~~~~

As for other signals, to determine what happens when an event occurs we
call `connect`{.LITERAL} method. But we also need let GTK know which
events we want to be notified about. To do this, we call the method:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
method event#add : Gdk.Tags.event_mask list -> unit
~~~~

The argument specifies the events we are interested in. It is the list
of constants that specify different types of events. For future
reference the Gdk.Tags.event\_mask are:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
type event_mask = [ `ALL_EVENTS
    | `BUTTON1_MOTION
    | `BUTTON2_MOTION
    | `BUTTON3_MOTION
    | `BUTTON_MOTION
    | `BUTTON_PRESS
    | `BUTTON_RELEASE
    | `ENTER_NOTIFY
    | `EXPOSURE
    | `FOCUS_CHANGE
    | `KEY_PRESS
    | `KEY_RELEASE
    | `LEAVE_NOTIFY
    | `POINTER_MOTION
    | `POINTER_MOTION_HINT
    | `PROPERTY_CHANGE
    | `PROXIMITY_IN
    | `PROXIMITY_OUT
    | `SCROLL
    | `STRUCTURE
    | `SUBSTRUCTURE
    | `VISIBILITY_NOTIFY ] 
~~~~

There are a few subtle points that have to be observed when calling
`event#add`{.LITERAL} method. First, it must be called before the X
window for a GTK widget is created. In practical terms, this means you
should call it immediately after creating the widget. Second, the widget
must have an associated X window. For efficiency, many widget types do
not have their own window, but draw in their parent's window. These
widgets are:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
GtkAlignment
GtkArrow
GtkBin
GtkBox
GtkImage
GtkItem
GtkLabel
GtkPixmap
GtkScrolledWindow
GtkSeparator
GtkTable
GtkAspectFrame
GtkFrame
GtkVBox
GtkHBox
GtkVSeparator
GtkHSeparator
~~~~

To capture events for these widgets, you need to use an EventBox widget.
See the section on the [EventBox](c1436.html#SEC-EVENTBOX) widget for
details.

For our drawing program, we want to know when the mouse button is
pressed and when the mouse is moved, so we specify
`` `POINTER_MOTION ``{.LITERAL} and `` `BUTTON_PRESS ``{.LITERAL}. We
also want to know when we need to redraw our window, so we specify
`` `EXPOSURE ``{.LITERAL}. Although we want to be notified via a
Configure event when our window size changes, we don't have to specify
the corresponding `` `STRUCTURE ``{.LITERAL} flag, because it is
automatically specified for all windows.

It turns out, however, that there is a problem with just specifying
`` `POINTER_MOTION ``{.LITERAL}. This will cause the server to add a new
motion event to the event queue every time the user moves the mouse.
Imagine that it takes us 0.1 seconds to handle a motion event, but the X
server queues a new motion event every 0.05 seconds. We will soon get
way behind the users drawing. If the user draws for 5 seconds, it will
take us another 5 seconds to catch up after they release the mouse
button! What we would like is to only get one motion event for each
event we process. The way to do this is to specify
`` `POINTER_MOTION_HINT ``{.LITERAL}.

When we specify `` `POINTER_MOTION_HINT ``{.LITERAL}, the server sends
us a motion event the first time the pointer moves after entering our
window, or after a button press or release event. Subsequent motion
events will be suppressed until we explicitly ask for the position of
the pointer using the function:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
val Gdk.Window.get_pointer_location : Gdk.window -> int * int
~~~~

There is another method, `misc#pointer`{.LITERAL} method which has a
simpler interface:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
method misc#pointer : int * int
~~~~

The code to set the events for our window then looks like:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
  drawing_area#event#connect#expose ~callback:expose;
  drawing_area#event#connect#configure ~callback:configure;
  drawing_area#event#connect#motion_notify ~callback:motion_notify;
  drawing_area#event#connect#button_press ~callback:button_pressed;

  drawing_area#event#add [`EXPOSURE;
    `LEAVE_NOTIFY;
    `BUTTON_PRESS;
    `POINTER_MOTION;
    `POINTER_MOTION_HINT];
~~~~

We'll save the "expose" and "configure" callbacks for later. The
"motion\_notify" and "button\_pressed" callbacks are pretty simple:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
let button_pressed area backing ev =
  if GdkEvent.Button.button ev = 1 then (
    let x = int_of_float (GdkEvent.Button.x ev) in
    let y = int_of_float (GdkEvent.Button.y ev) in
    draw_brush area backing x y
  );
  true

let motion_notify area backing ev =
  let (x, y) =
    if GdkEvent.Motion.is_hint ev
    then area#misc#pointer
    else
      (int_of_float (GdkEvent.Motion.x ev), int_of_float (GdkEvent.Motion.y ev))
  in
  let state = GdkEvent.Motion.state ev in
  if Gdk.Convert.test_modifier `BUTTON1 state
  then draw_brush area backing x y;
  true
~~~~
