The Tooltips Object {.SECT1}
===================

These are the little text strings that pop up when you leave your
pointer over a button or other widget for a few seconds. They are easy
to use, so I will just explain them without giving an example. If you
want to see some code, take a look at the `testgtk.ml`{.FILENAME}
program distributed with LablGTK.

Widgets that do not receive events (widgets that do not have their own
window) will not work with tooltips.

The first call you will use creates a new tooltip using
[`GData.tooltips`{.LITERAL}](http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GData.html#VALtooltips)
function. You only need to do this once for a set of tooltips as the
[`GData.tooltips object`{.LITERAL}](http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GData.tooltips-c.html)
this function returns can be used to create multiple tooltips.

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
val GData.tooltips : ?delay:int -> unit -> tooltips
~~~~

Once you have created a new tooltip, and the widget you wish to use it
on, simply use this call to set it:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
method set_tip : ?text:string -> ?privat:string -> GObj.widget -> unit
~~~~

The `?text`{.LITERAL} argument is the text you with to say, which is
followed by the widget you wish to have this tooltip pop up for wish it
to say. The `?privat`{.LITERAL} argument is a text string that can be
used as an identifier when using GtkTipsQuery to implement context
sensitive help. For now, you don't have to give it.

Here's a short example:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
let tooltips = GData.tooltips () in
let button = GButton.button ~label:"This is button1" () in
.
.
.
tooltips#set_tip button#coerce ~text:"This is button1";
~~~~

There are other calls that can be used with tooltips. I will just list
them with a brief description of what they do.

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
method enable : unit -> unit
~~~~

Enable a disabled set of tooltips.

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
method disable : unit -> unit
~~~~

Disable an enabled set of tooltips.
