# Here is a list of all the possible states.  Note that some do not apply to
# certain widgets.
#
# NORMAL - The normal state of a widget, without the mouse over top of
# it, and not being pressed, etc.
#
# PRELIGHT - When the mouse is over top of the widget, colors defined
# using this state will be in effect.
#
# ACTIVE - When the widget is pressed or clicked it will be active, and
# the attributes assigned by this tag will be in effect.
#
# INSENSITIVE - When a widget is set insensitive, and cannot be
# activated, it will take these attributes.
#
# SELECTED - When an object is selected, it takes these attributes.
#
# Given these states, we can set the attributes of the widgets in each of
# these states using the following directives.
#
# fg - Sets the foreground color of a widget.
# fg - Sets the background color of a widget.
# bg_pixmap - Sets the background of a widget to a tiled pixmap.
# font - Sets the font to be used with the given widget.
#

# This sets a style called "button".  The name is not really important, as
# it is assigned to the actual widgets at the bottom of the file.

  #This sets the padding around the window to the pixmap specified.

  #Sets the foreground color (font color) to red when in the "NORMAL"
  #state.

  #Sets the background pixmap of this widget to that of its parent.
  bg_pixmap[NORMAL] = "<parent>"
}

style "button"
{
  # This shows all the possible states for a button.  The only one that
  # doesn't apply is the SELECTED state.

  bg[INSENSITIVE] = { 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 }
  fg[INSENSITIVE] = { 1.0, 0, 1.0 }

# In this example, we inherit the attributes of the "button" style and then
# override the font and background color when prelit to create a new
# "main_button" style.

# These set the widget types to use the styles defined above.
# The widget types are listed in the class hierarchy, but could probably be
# just listed in this document for the users reference.

widget_class "GtkWindow" style "window"
widget_class "GtkDialog" style "window"
widget_class "GtkFileSelection" style "window"
widget_class "*Gtk*Scale" style "scale"
widget_class "*GtkCheckButton*" style "toggle_button"
widget_class "*GtkRadioButton*" style "toggle_button"
widget_class "*GtkButton*" style "button"
widget_class "*Ruler" style "ruler"
widget_class "*GtkText" style "text"

# This sets all the buttons that are children of the "main window" to
# the main_button style.  These must be documented to be taken advantage of.
widget "main window.*GtkButton*" style "main_button"
