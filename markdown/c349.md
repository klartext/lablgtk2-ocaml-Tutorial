More on Signal Handlers {.SECT1}
=======================

Lets take another look at the \#connect\#*signal\_name* declaration.

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
#connect#signal_name ~callback:(unit -> unit) -> GtkSignal.id
~~~~

Notice the GtkSignal.id return value? This is a tag that identifies your
callback function. As stated above, you may have as many callbacks per
signal and per object as you need, and each will be executed in turn, in
the order they were attached.

This tag allows you to remove this callback from the list by using
[`#misc#disconnect`{.LITERAL}](http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GObj.gobject_ops-c.html#METHODdisconnect)
method:

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
#misc#disconnect: GtkSignal.id -> unit
~~~~

So, by passing the tag returned by one of the connect functions to the
[`#misc#disconnect`{.LITERAL}](http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GObj.gobject_ops-c.html#METHODdisconnect)
method, you can disconnect a signal handler.

You can also temporarily disable signal handlers with the
[`#misc#handler_block`{.LITERAL}](http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GObj.gobject_ops-c.html#METHODhandler_block)
and
[`#misc#handler_unblock`{.LITERAL}](http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GObj.gobject_ops-c.html#METHODhandler_unblock)
family of functions.

~~~~ {.PROGRAMLISTING}
#misc#handler_block : GtkSignal.id -> unit
#misc#handler_unblock : GtkSignal.id -> unit
~~~~
