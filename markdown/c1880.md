Undocumented Widgets
====================

These all require authors! :) Please consider contributing to our
tutorial.

If you must use one of these widgets that are undocumented, I strongly
suggest you take a look at their respective header files in the GTK
distribution. GTK's function names are very descriptive. Once you have
an understanding of how things work, it's not difficult to figure out
how to use a widget simply by looking at its function declarations.
This, along with a few examples from others' code, and it should be no
problem.

When you do come to understand all the functions of a new undocumented
widget, please consider writing a tutorial on it so others may benefit
from your time.
