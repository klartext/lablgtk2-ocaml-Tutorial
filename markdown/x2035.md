Properties {.SECT1}
==========

Drag data has the following properties:

-   Drag action type (ie \`COPY, \`MOVE).

-   Client specified arbitrary drag-and-drop type (a name and number
    pair).

-   Sent and received data format type.

Drag actions are quite obvious, they specify if the widget can drag with
the specified action(s), e.g. \`COPY and/or \`MOVE. A \`COPY would be a
typical drag-and-drop without the source data being deleted while \`MOVE
would be just like \`COPY but the source data will be 'suggested' to be
deleted after the received signal handler is called. There are
additional drag actions including \`LINK which you may want to look into
when you get to more advanced levels of drag-and-drop.

The client specified arbitrary drag-and-drop type is much more flexible,
because your application will be defining and checking for that
specifically. You will need to set up your destination widgets to
receive certain drag-and-drop types by specifying a name and/or number.
It would be more reliable to use a name since another application may
just happen to use the same number for an entirely different meaning.
