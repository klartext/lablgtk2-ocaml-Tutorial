This is fairly straightforward. Memory is
allocated for the GtkWidget *window structure so it now points to a
valid structure. It sets up a new window, but it is not displayed
until we call

to set an attribute of a container object.
This just sets the window so it has a blank area along the inside of
it 10 pixels wide where no widgets will go. There are other similar
functions which we will look at in the section on
<A
HREF="c1933.html"
>Setting Widget Attributes</A
></P
><P
>Here are two examples of connecting a signal handler to an object, in
this case, the window. Here, the "delete_event" and "destroy" signals
are caught. The first is emitted when we use the window manager to
kill the window, or when we use the

call passing
in the window widget as the object to destroy. The second is emitted
when, in the "delete_event" handler, we return <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>false</TT
>.
 
The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>G_OBJECT</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>G_CALLBACK</TT

that perform type casting and checking for us, as well as aid the readability of
the code.</P

which will be explained in depth later on in
<A
HREF="c383.html"
>Packing Widgets</A
>. But it is
fairly easy to understand. It simply tells GTK that the button is to
be placed in the window where it will be displayed. Note that a GTK
container can only contain one widget. There are other widgets, that
are described later, which are designed to layout multiple widgets in
various ways.
 </P
><P
>Here, we take this button, and make it do something useful. We attach
a signal handler to it so when it emits the "clicked" signal, our
hello() function is called.
Obviously, the "clicked" signal
is emitted when we click the button with our mouse pointer.</P

>We are also going to use this button to exit our program. This will
illustrate how the "destroy" signal may come from either the window
manager, or our program. When the button is "clicked", same as above,
it calls the first hello() callback function, and then this one in the
order they are set up. You may have as many callback functions as you
need, and all will be executed in the order you connected
them.</P

>Now we have everything set up the way we want it to be. With all the
signal handlers in place, and the button placed in the window where it
should be, we ask GTK to "show" the widgets on the screen.
All widgets are "shown" by default except window widget.
The window widget is shown last so the whole window will pop up at once rather
than seeing the window pop up, and then the button form inside of
it. Although with such a simple example, you'd never notice.</P

>Now, when we click the mouse button on a GTK button, the widget emits
a "clicked" signal. In order for us to use this information, our
program sets up a signal handler to catch that signal, which
dispatches the function of our choice. In our example, when the button
we created is "clicked", the hello() function is called
, and then the next handler for this signal is called. This
calls the
<A
HREF="http://compiler.kaist.ac.kr/~shoh/ocaml/lablgtk2/lablgtk-2.4.0/doc/html/GObj.gtkobj.html#METHODdestroy"
TARGET="_top"
><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>window#destroy ()</TT
></A
>
function,
destroying the window widget. This causes the window
to emit the "destroy" signal, which is caught, and calls our destroy()
callback function, which simply exits GTK.</P
><P
>Another course of events is to use the window manager to kill the
window, which will cause the "delete_event" to be emitted. This will
call our "delete_event" handler. If we return <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>true</TT
> here,
the window
will be left as is and nothing will happen. Returning <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>false</TT
>
will cause
GTK to emit the "destroy" signal which of course calls the "destroy"
callback, exiting GTK.</P
