through the example <i class="EMPHASIS">helloworld</i> program.</p><p>Here is the callback function that will be called when the button is
"clicked". We ignore both the widget and the data in this example, but
it is not hard to do things with them. The next example will use the
data argument to tell us which button was pressed.</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">let hello () =
  print_endline "Hello World";
  flush stdout</pre></td></tr></table><p>The next callback is a bit special. The "delete_event" occurs when the
window manager sends this event to the application. We have a choice
here as to what to do about these events. We can ignore them, make
some sort of response, or simply quit the application.</p><p>The value you return in this callback lets GTK know what action to
take.  By returning <tt class="LITERAL">true</tt>,
we let it know that <i class="EMPHASIS">we don't want</i> to have
the "destroy" signal emitted, keeping our application running. By
returning <tt class="LITERAL">false</tt>,
we ask that "destroy" be emitted, which in turn will
call our "destroy" signal handler.</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">let delete_event ev =
  print_endline "Delete event occurred";
  flush stdout;
  true</pre></td></tr></table><p>Here is another callback function which causes the program to quit by
calling
<a href="http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GMain.Main.html#VALquit" target="_top"><tt class="LITERAL">GMain.Main.quit ()</tt></a>.
This function tells GTK that it is to exit
from
<a href="http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GMain.Main.html#VALmain" target="_top"><tt class="LITERAL">GMain.Main.main</tt></a>
when control is returned to it.</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">let destroy () = GMain.Main.quit ()</pre></td></tr></table><p>In "C" language, you <i class="EMPHASIS">have to</i> use "main" for starting function name, but in "Ocaml", you don't have to. You may use any name for a
fuction, and we'll tell the system the name of the starting point.
In this example, we'll use "main" for the name of ther starting function.</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">let main () =</pre></td></tr></table><p>Create a new window using
<a href="http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GWindow.html#VALwindow" target="_top"><tt class="LITERAL">GWindow.window</tt></a>.
This is fairly straightforward. Memory is
allocated for the GtkWidget *window structure so it now points to a
valid structure. It sets up a new window, but it is not displayed
until we call
<a href="http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GWindow.window_skel.html#METHODshow" target="_top"><tt class="LITERAL">window#show ()</tt></a>
near the end of our program.</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">  let window = GWindow.window ~border_width:10 () in</pre></td></tr></table><p>This <tt class="LITERAL">~border_width</tt> option is used
to set an attribute of a container object.
This just sets the window so it has a blank area along the inside of
it 10 pixels wide where no widgets will go. There are other similar
functions which we will look at in the section on
<a href="c1933.html">Setting Widget Attributes</a></p><p>Here are two examples of connecting a signal handler to an object, in
this case, the window. Here, the "delete_event" and "destroy" signals
are caught. The first is emitted when we use the window manager to
kill the window, or when we use the
<a href="http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GObj.gtkobj.html#METHODdestroy" target="_top"><tt class="LITERAL">window#destroy ()</tt></a>
call passing
in the window widget as the object to destroy. The second is emitted
when, in the "delete_event" handler, we return <tt class="LITERAL">false</tt>.
 
The <tt class="LITERAL">G_OBJECT</tt> and <tt class="LITERAL">G_CALLBACK</tt> are macros 
that perform type casting and checking for us, as well as aid the readability of
the code.</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">  window#event#connect#delete ~callback:delete_event;
  window#connect#destroy ~callback:destroy;</pre></td></tr></table><p>This call creates a new button. It allocates space for a new GtkWidget
structure in memory, initializes it, and makes the button pointer
point to it. It will have the label "Hello World" on it when
displayed.</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">  let button = GButton.button ~label:"Hello World" ~packing:window#add () in</pre></td></tr></table><p>There is a <tt class="LITERAL">~packing</tt> option,
which will be explained in depth later on in
<a href="c383.html">Packing Widgets</a>. But it is
fairly easy to understand. It simply tells GTK that the button is to
be placed in the window where it will be displayed. Note that a GTK
container can only contain one widget. There are other widgets, that
are described later, which are designed to layout multiple widgets in
various ways.
 </p><p>Here, we take this button, and make it do something useful. We attach
a signal handler to it so when it emits the "clicked" signal, our
hello() function is called.
Obviously, the "clicked" signal
is emitted when we click the button with our mouse pointer.</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">  button#connect#clicked ~callback:hello;</pre></td></tr></table><p>We are also going to use this button to exit our program. This will
illustrate how the "destroy" signal may come from either the window
manager, or our program. When the button is "clicked", same as above,
it calls the first hello() callback function, and then this one in the
order they are set up. You may have as many callback functions as you
need, and all will be executed in the order you connected
them.</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">  button#connect#clicked ~callback:window#destroy;</pre></td></tr></table><p>Now we have everything set up the way we want it to be. With all the
signal handlers in place, and the button placed in the window where it
should be, we ask GTK to "show" the widgets on the screen.
All widgets are "shown" by default except window widget.
The window widget is shown last so the whole window will pop up at once rather
than seeing the window pop up, and then the button form inside of
it. Although with such a simple example, you'd never notice.</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">  window#show ();
  GMain.Main.main ()</pre></td></tr></table><p>And of course, we call
<a href="http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GMain.Main.html#VALmain" target="_top"><tt class="LITERAL">GMain.Main.main ()</tt></a>
which waits for events to come from
the X server/Window and will call on the widgets to emit signals when these
events come.</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">  GMain.Main.main ()</pre></td></tr></table><p>And for the final thing, we should tell the system how to do this application. On executing the following line, the function named "main" will be called.</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">let _ = main ()</pre></td></tr></table><p>or, if you want to see error message which is raised on evaluating
<tt class="LITERAL">main ()</tt> functon:</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tr><td><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">let _ = Printexc.print main ()</pre></td></tr></table><p>Now, when we click the mouse button on a GTK button, the widget emits
a "clicked" signal. In order for us to use this information, our
program sets up a signal handler to catch that signal, which
dispatches the function of our choice. In our example, when the button
we created is "clicked", the hello() function is called
, and then the next handler for this signal is called. This
calls the
<a href="http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GObj.gtkobj.html#METHODdestroy" target="_top"><tt class="LITERAL">window#destroy ()</tt></a>
function,
destroying the window widget. This causes the window
to emit the "destroy" signal, which is caught, and calls our destroy()
callback function, which simply exits GTK.</p><p>Another course of events is to use the window manager to kill the
window, which will cause the "delete_event" to be emitted. This will
call our "delete_event" handler. If we return <tt class="LITERAL">true</tt> here,
the window
will be left as is and nothing will happen. Returning <tt class="LITERAL">false</tt>
will cause
GTK to emit the "destroy" signal which of course calls the "destroy"
callback, exiting GTK.</p></div><div class="NAVFOOTER"><hr align="LEFT" width="100%"/><table summary="Footer navigation table" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td width="33%" align="left" valign="top"><a href="x181.html" accesskey="P">&#60;&#60;&#60; Previous</a></td><td width="34%" align="center" valign="top"><a href="book1.html" accesskey="H">Home</a></td><td width="33%" align="right" valign="top"><a href="c349.html" accesskey="N">Next &#62;&#62;&#62;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="33%" align="left" valign="top">Events</td><td width="34%" align="center" valign="top"><a href="c108.html" accesskey="U">Up</a></td><td width="33%" align="right" valign="top">Moving On</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
