<h1 class="SECT1">Key and Mouse bindings</h1>
<p>All of the GTK range widgets react to mouse clicks in more or less the same way. Clicking button-1 in the trough will cause its adjustment's <code class="LITERAL">page_increment</code> to be added or subtracted from its <code class="LITERAL">value</code>, and the slider to be moved accordingly. Clicking mouse button-2 in the trough will jump the slider to the point at which the button was clicked. Clicking button-3 in the trough of a range or any button on a scrollbar's arrows will cause its adjustment's value to change by <code class="LITERAL">step_increment</code> at a time.</p>
<p>Scrollbars are not focusable, thus have no key bindings. The key bindings for the other range widgets (which are, of course, only active when the widget has focus) are do <em>not</em> differentiate between horizontal and vertical range widgets.</p>
<p>All range widgets can be operated with the left, right, up and down arrow keys, as well as with the <code class="LITERAL">Page Up</code> and <code class="LITERAL">Page Down</code> keys. The arrows move the slider up and down by <code class="LITERAL">step_increment</code>, while <code class="LITERAL">Page Up</code> and <code class="LITERAL">Page Down</code> move it by <code class="LITERAL">page_increment</code>.</p>
<p>The user can also move the slider all the way to one end or the other of the trough using the keyboard. This is done with the <code class="LITERAL">Home</code> and <code class="LITERAL">End</code> keys.</p>
