<h1>Packing Widgets</h1>
<p>When creating an application, you'll want to put more than one widget inside a window. Our first <em>helloworld</em> example only used one widget so we could simply use a #add (or #pack) method call to &quot;pack&quot; the widget into the window. But when you want to put more than one widget into a window, how do you control where that widget is positioned? This is where packing comes in.</p>
<h1 class="SECT1">Theory of Packing Boxes</h1>
<p>Most packing is done by creating boxes. These are invisible widget containers that we can pack our widgets into which come in two forms, a horizontal box, and a vertical box. When packing widgets into a horizontal box, the objects are inserted horizontally from left to right or right to left depending on the call used. In a vertical box, widgets are packed from top to bottom or vice versa. You may use any combination of boxes inside or beside other boxes to create the desired effect.</p>
<p>To create a new horizontal box, we use a call to <a href="http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GPack.html#VALhbox"><code class="LITERAL">GPack.hbox ()</code></a>, and for vertical boxes, <a href="http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GPack.html#VALvbox"><code class="LITERAL">GPack.vbox ()</code></a>. The <a href="http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GPack.box_skel.html#METHODpack"><code class="LITERAL">box#pack</code></a> or <a href="http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GContainer.container-c.html#METHODadd"><code class="LITERAL">box#add</code></a> method is used to place objects inside of these containers. An object may be another container or a widget. In fact, many widgets are actually containers themselves, including the button, but we usually only use a label inside a button.</p>
<p>By using this method, GTK knows where you want to place your widgets so it can do automatic resizing and other nifty things. There are also a number of options as to how your widgets should be packed. As you can imagine, this method gives us a quite a bit of flexibility when placing and creating widgets.</p>
